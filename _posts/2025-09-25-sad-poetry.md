**Possum**

It was a month for death  
I guess, or seemed that way at least,  
When little losses swept  
Like leaves against the trees and made  
A litter where you lay, half born,  
A broken little thing  
Still slick with birth juice,  
All blind and oily, trembling  
A frantic frequency.  

I felt your life was coiled  
In that ring tailed muscular knot  
That bound you boa tight –  
A serpent strangling – knuckled white  
And fraught. Your time unwinding meant  
The stress was holding at  
The threshold, where the light  
Bends back upon itself and waits  
And there is nothing else.  

I tried to climb you back  
Into your tree. An easy height  
I thought, just far enough  
So that your mother would descend  
To where the knotted branches made  
A secret hiding place  
From time and other threats  
That scuttle in the dirt and write  
Scripture for the Zulu gods.  

But I was un-careful  
With you, or else you meant to fall,  
You twitched and slipped and arched  
Into a final spiral. And  
I watched and knew that now the blame  
Was mine, the traumas passed  
Are stains that will not wash,  
And I am scarred by running fast  
And failing. Always. Stop.  

**The earth life**

Gnat fuzz hums on pregnant buds  
While fruits, fleshy and swollen,  
Arch and bend on fattened stems  
And dewy blebs roll and fall  
To heaving soils, where grubs  
Congregate endlessly.  

The season is thickening:  
Its scent concentrates, like ether,  
In creeping clouds, blending  
The giddy whirr of mosquitoes  
Into amnesia and penitence  
And a clutching of roots.  

This is my earth life: to follow  
The worm's meandering,  
Through saw-jaws, the spider's scrawl,  
On paths traced, untraced and retraced,  
By Brownian ants, millipedes  
And others, less imagined.  

**A song for Auden**

Stop the clocks, Auden said,  
Like grief was something quiet  
And still; a deep breath and calming  
Exhalation, soughed  
Through stiff lips by stoic men  
In mourning dress on damp  
Tarmac streets, where heavy skies,  
And terraces with dun,  
Rendered walls and sodden lawns,  
Dull the hearse’s engine,  
Effect numb the congregation.  

And though the poet turns  
The verse to private lamentation  
And writes his loss across  
The skies and finds no words worth  
Rhyming: it’s not enough.  

The clock is stopped, the world stilled,  
The metre’s taken measure,  
The loss is parsed in careful, weighted  
Metaphor – because  
Auden’s too refined to say  
That grief is snot and fury,  
Torn photographs and ragged  
Scabs and endless hours  
Spent in tortured spinning circles.  
And Time’s the frozen vortex  
Where we once floated,  
I am now sinking,  
Raging, and nothing ever changes.  

What world waits for Auden,  
But will not wait for me?  

**Still life**

There is a button missing, the thread  
unwinds across a gut too heavy for  
its frame.  
 
He sits in grey-light, very still,  
and half lid eyes urge on  
the fading day.  

He grew old slowly; shadows seeped  
through tired rooms,  
fabric frayed, the edges  
first diminished.  

Upon the mantle, photographs,  
like mourners at a wake.  

In one a couple sits, a crowded  
rooftop scene; they have the  
corner seat.  

Across the city, blue lights and neon glow  
and traffic flare like fire burning low.
